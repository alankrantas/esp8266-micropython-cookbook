# ESP8266 Deep Sleep/Cloud Data Update

# Upload this script onto the board as main.py, then remember to
# connect D0 (GPIO 16) and RST with a jumper wire in order to
# wake the board from deep sleep.

# You can also maunally wake it up by pressing the RST button or
# pull RST low with an external switch.

# Afterwards, you may need to re-flash the firmware to reset ESP8266.
